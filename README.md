## Dependency Management
Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `package.json` file during the deployment process.

## Web Server Setup

### Port
Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and **not** hard-code it into the application. Use `process.env.PORT` in your code when referring to the server port. 

```
app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Hello World Application is running on port ${process.env.PORT}`)
})
```

### Start Command
Kinsta will automatically create a web process with `npm start` as the entry point when deploying an application. Make sure to use this command to run your server. If you want to use another command, you must modify the runtime process in MyKinsta.

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
```

## Deployment Lifecycle
Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit) the `npm build` command is run, followed by the `npm start` command.  

## What is Node.JS
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser, enabling server-side scripting and building scalable network applications. It utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle concurrent requests and real-time applications efficiently. Learn more on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
